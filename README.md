ðŸ”§ Stack Overview
Infrastructure: EKS (via Terraform)
GitOps Tool: ArgoCD
Monitoring: kube-prometheus-stack (Prometheus + Grafana via Helm)
Security Scans: Trivy, OWASP, SonarCloud


# Steps to note
1. Design your  terraform directory structure. Setup your root module for your environments (dev,staging and prod) and your resuable child modules. Below is the directory structure

â”œâ”€â”€ environments/         # Root modules for dev, staging, prod
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dev/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ staging/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ prod/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/              # Reusable child modules
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ eks/              # EKS cluster provisioning
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ rds/              # RDS database
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ iam/              # IAM roles and policies
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ s3/               # S3 storage
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ kms/              # KMS key management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ route53/          # DNS management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cloudfront/       # CDN distribution
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config/           # AWS Config rules
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/              # User data scripts (e.g., Docker install)
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/workflows/    # GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
â”œâ”€â”€ .pre-commit-config.yaml # Pre-commit hooks (fmt, tflint, checkov, trivy, sonar)
â””â”€â”€ README.md


2. Start with your IAM roles and policies for your child modules that require permissions(best practice). Add permission boundaries to ensure least privilege access. Create a role and call it "terraform-role". Create an OIDC provider for github(use the youtube video link below to guide you) for a Federated User. Attach the oidc policy or permissions to the terraform role. The policy will give the terraform role the least access privilege. This adds another security layer for github to access your aws account through the oidc Fed provider. see below the oidc policy to be attached to the terraform role.

2. Build your EKS module; there are serveral options. You can use terraform directly or use cloudformation to build your EKS and nodegroup stack. You can then use cloudformation to deploy the stacks together.

3. As best practice, add the ff. to be installed on the EKS for cluster management.
# ALB controller to allow an ALB to be provisioned via the ingress k8s manifest file
# Argocd for gitOps operations. This will automatically handle your container(k8s) apps of apps
# EBS CSI Driver - This will aid in provisioning additional EBS volumes for your nodes
# Prometheus-Grafana Stack - This pack will install both prometheus and grafana on the cluster and accessed by your ingress. It is best practice to access it locally though via your localhost
# VPC CNI Driver is required for your EKS to be successfully deployed. It needs to be part of your addons.
# Setup the above-mentioned addons as reuseable modules so that it is easily maintained
# NB: Your EKS cluster will come with its own VPC and EC2s(nodes), thus you don't need  VPC and EC2 modules.

4. Build the rest of your child modules including S3, KMS, Config, RDS, CloudFront and Route53. Ensure each module is attached to the its IAM role with descriptions for team members to easily understand and reuse.

5. Reference the modules that are connected and test them one after the other as you build and add on.

6. Create a separate directory for your k8s manifest files and organise the frontend, backend and db tiers in separate directories. Below is how your k8s files should be setup.
k8s/
â”œâ”€â”€ bootstrap/  # ArgoCD root applications for each environment
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shared-app.yml
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app-dev.yml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ root-app-dev.yml    # ArgoCD App pointing to apps/dev (dev workloads)    
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ root-app-prod.yml   # ArgoCD App pointing to apps/prod (prod workloads)
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/                 # Common resources shared by all apps/environments
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ configmap.yml       # Shared config (e.g., mongo URL)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ secrets.yml         # Shared secrets (e.g., MongoDB credentials)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ namespace.yml
â””â”€â”€ apps/                   # Application workloads grouped by environment
    â”œâ”€â”€ dev/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ web-app/        # Web frontend microservice
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ token-app/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mongo/          # MongoDB deployment (not exposed via Ingress)
    â””â”€â”€ prod/

# GitOps 
Your applications or microservices share certain k8s files including configmaps, secrets and namespace. You should have one directory for shared files.
âœ… ArgoCD App of Apps Structure

* `bootstrap/root-app-dev.yml`: Defines ArgoCD root application pointing to `apps/`.
* `apps/shared-app.yml`: Deploys ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Namespace common to all applications.
* `apps/app-dev.yml`: Deploys individual dev apps (web, token, mongo) under the shared namespace.

# How to access your argocd

7. Install pre-commit and checkov. Just like gitignore, create config files to override checkov and pre-commit errors that are deprecated or not threatening. See examples below.

# Pre-commit
.checkov.yml
framework: terraform

skip-check:
  - CKV2_AWS_62     # Event notifications not required for log bucket
  - CKV_AWS_290     # Acceptable write access in dev for flow logs
  - CKV_AWS_145     # SSE-KMS not enforced in dev
  - CKV_AWS_144     # Cross-region replication not required for dev logs
  - CKV2_AWS_11     # VPC flow logs are handled dynamically
  - CKV_AWS_300     # Lifecycle rule handles abort incomplete uploads
  - CKV2_AWS_12     # Default SG restricted via module logic


.pre-commit-config.yml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform
    rev: v1.100.0
    hooks:
      - id: terraform_fmt
      - id: terraform_tflint
      # remove terraform_checkov since weâ€™ll use the official Checkov hook

  - repo: https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov
    rev: 3.2.471   # pin latest stable
    hooks:
      - id: checkov
        args: [--quiet, -d, .]   # optional: make it match your CLI usage

8. You can choose to install sonarqube and checkov locally to check your code quality or you can include it in your git workflow to use sonarcloud(scan on build). Depending on the language or application code, you can get the sonarqube job from git marketplace. Below are sonarqube and checkov jobs used for this project workflow. 

checkov:
    name: Run Checkov
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Checkov Scan
        uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@master
        with:
          directory: .
          quiet: true
          soft_fail: false

  sonarcloud:
    name: Run SonarCloud Code Quality Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install SonarCloud Scanner
        run: |
          curl -sSLo sonar-scanner.zip https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonar-scanner-cli/sonar-scanner-cli-5.0.1.3006-linux.zip
          unzip -q sonar-scanner.zip
          echo "$PWD/sonar-scanner-5.0.1.3006-linux/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
      - name: SonarCloud Scan
        env:
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          sonar-scanner \
            -Dsonar.projectKey=${SONAR_PROJECT_KEY} \
            -Dsonar.organization=${SONAR_ORGANIZATION} \
            -Dsonar.branch.name=${GITHUB_REF_NAME} \
            -Dsonar.sources=. \
            -Dsonar.host.url=https://sonarcloud.io \
            -Dsonar.login=$SONAR_TOKEN


# Sonarcloud Setup
Go to the sonarcloud website and register. You can also login with you github account and it automatically connects with your repos.
Once you are logged in, create an organisation and add your repos as projects. This will automatically generate the project key (SONAR_PROJECT_KEY) and (SONAR_ORGANIZATION) which you can define as environmental variables in your workflow. eg.
env:
  TF_VAR_management_account_id: ${{ secrets.AWS_MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_ID }}
  TF_VAR_dev_account_id: ${{ secrets.AWS_DEV_ACCOUNT_ID }}
  AWS_REGION: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
  SONAR_PROJECT_KEY: dainmusty_MULTI-VPC-INTER-REGION-TGW
  SONAR_ORGANIZATION: effulgencetech


# Git Actions setup
9. Create a directory called .github , inside that directory, create another directory and call it workflows. Now create a yaml file inside workflows, you can give it any name. eg. terraform-apply-manual-destroy.yaml.

10. Define your workflow. The components of the workflow will depend on what expected in the project. For example, in this project, we want CICD of k8s microservices which is to be deployed by terraform and managed by argoCD. The workflow can be sectioned into 3 parts. 
Part 1 - trigger upon git push to a feature branch say dev
Part 2 - defining your environmental variables
Part 3 - actual jobs which includes the code scans, infra deployment and GitOps activities. eg. terraform plan,apply and manual destroy, k8s manifest files deployment by argocd. scans include code quality, code vulnerability, code dependency and k8s image scans.
Part 4 - Configuring credentials
See below the workflow for this project.

Part 1 - Trigger upon push
# name: Full CI/CD Pipeline

# on:
#   push:
#     branches:
#       - main
#   pull_request:

Part 2 - defining your environmental variables
 
# env:
#   AWS_REGION: us-east-1
#   CLUSTER_NAME: dev_eks_cluster
#   SONAR_PROJECT_KEY: dainmusty_ENTERPRISE-BUSINESS-TERRAFORM-INFRA
#   SONAR_ORGANIZATION: effulgencetech

Part 3 - scans; it could be code quality, code vulnerability, code dependency and k8s image scans.

11. Once you define your credentials for eg. aws access keys and secret access keys, then you go to github and register or create all the access controls. This is to allow GitActions to permit terraform to access your aws account including they aws region you are working in. Go to the repo you are working on in github, go to settings, go to actions/variables, then create the secrets below for terraform. You also need to create a secret for the sonarqube token and paste the value generated for the project in sonarcloud.see below that section in the workflow

# - name: Configure AWS credentials
#         uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
#         with:
#           aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
#           aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
#           aws-region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}
# SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
#         run: |
#           sonar-scanner \
