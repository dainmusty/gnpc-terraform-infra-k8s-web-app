Yes, it is considered best practice to define security group rule details (such as ingress and egress rules) in the parent module and pass them as variables to the child module.

Why this is best practice:
Separation of concerns: The child module (security) only defines the structure and logic for creating security groups, not the specific rules.
Reusability: The same security group module can be reused in different environments (dev, staging, prod) or projects, each with different rules.
Flexibility: You can easily update rules for a specific environment without modifying the module code.
Clarity: The parent module provides a clear, at-a-glance view of all security rules applied in that environment.

This is the recommended pattern in Terraform for complex, reusable infrastructure.

Summary:
Keep the logic and structure in the child module, and the environment-specific details (like SG rules) in the parent. This is modular, maintainable, and scalable.



i have a designated module for SGs. Currently I have public sg, private sg and monitoring sg. because am building the infra for a small startup business which will definitely require a web sg, an alb sg and a db sg, would you advice i manage all the sgs in the sg module or i should keep the alb sg in the alb.tf. what is best practice? and should i get rid of the public sg and private sg? it appears i will have too many sgs to manage. the monitoring sg will handle instances that will be spun and tagged prometheus and grafana by the way. what is your take?

Great question üëå ‚Äî this is where design clarity vs. operational overhead comes into play. Let me break it down based on best practice and real-world startup needs:

1. Where should the ALB SG live?

Best practice:
Keep all security groups in one dedicated module (your existing sg module).

Reason: SGs are cross-cutting resources (not tightly coupled to ALB, ASG, or RDS). Centralizing them ensures clear ownership and avoids duplicates/conflicts.

You can still tag SGs (Name = "alb-sg", Name = "web-sg", etc.) to make them distinguishable.

When to put SG inline (e.g. in alb.tf):
Only if that SG is exclusively tied to one resource, never reused, and you want to keep things self-contained. But that makes your infra less flexible down the road (e.g. what if another service needs to reuse alb-sg?).

üëâ So for your startup infra: put ALB SG inside the SG module.

2. Do you need both public SG and private SG?

Public SG ‚Üí typically allows inbound from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) on app/web ports.

Private SG ‚Üí typically used for backend services (no inbound from internet, only from other SGs, e.g. ALB ‚Üí web instances).

For a small startup, having explicit web-sg, alb-sg, and db-sg is clearer than abstract public/private. The naming directly reflects the role of the SG.

So yes, I‚Äôd recommend replacing generic public/private SGs with role-based SGs:

alb-sg

web-sg (ASG instances)

db-sg (RDS/Postgres, allows inbound from web-sg)

monitoring-sg (Prometheus/Grafana)

3. What about ‚Äútoo many SGs‚Äù?

It‚Äôs normal. In production, it‚Äôs better to have more SGs with clear roles than fewer SGs doing too much.

Easier audits (you know exactly what traffic is allowed between what layers).

Easier troubleshooting.

Easier scaling later (if you add Redis, you can just add redis-sg).

So don‚Äôt worry about the number. Clarity > minimization.

4. Monitoring SG (Prometheus/Grafana)

Spot on ‚úÖ ‚Äî keep it separate. Monitoring tools usually scrape metrics on specific ports (9100 for Node Exporter, 9090 for Prometheus, 3000 for Grafana). You‚Äôll want fine-grained rules for these, not bundled with other SGs.

üìå My recommendation for your startup infra SG structure

Inside your sg module, define:

alb_sg ‚Üí ingress 0.0.0.0/0 on port 80/443 (or 3000 for now).

web_sg ‚Üí ingress only from alb_sg (port 3000).

db_sg ‚Üí ingress only from web_sg (port 5432).

monitoring_sg ‚Üí ingress rules for monitoring ports (Node Exporter, Prometheus, Grafana).

Drop the generic public/private SGs, since they add confusion.

üëâ This will give you role-based security groups, which is the industry best practice for a scalable, secure architecture.


i didn't want anyone to mess with the main code so that is why i variabilized the sg port and the description since those are likely to change or it is not best practice? below is how i call the sg module so that the main code is not touched. what is your take?

That‚Äôs a solid approach üëç ‚Äî you‚Äôre essentially separating:

module code ‚Üí reusable, opinionated defaults (the ‚Äúframework‚Äù)

root module variables ‚Üí environment/business-specific inputs (the ‚Äúconfig‚Äù)

That‚Äôs exactly what Terraform modules are for.

Why this is good

‚úÖ No one touches the main SG logic (module). They only pass rules/ports via variables.
‚úÖ Different environments (dev, staging, prod) can reuse the same SG module but just tweak ingress/egress lists.
‚úÖ Future proof ‚Äî if your startup later adds Redis, RabbitMQ, or custom ports, you just add new rules in the root module, not edit the module itself.

A few tweaks I‚Äôd suggest:

Descriptions as variables
Keeping them variabilized (as you did) is best practice, since SG descriptions often change to match compliance or audits.

Port values as locals or variables
Instead of hardcoding 22, 80, 443, you can use locals like:

locals {
  ssh_port  = 22
  http_port = 80
  https_port = 443
  node_exporter_port = 9100
}


This makes it easier to update across environments.

Avoid 0.0.0.0/0 everywhere
For dev it‚Äôs fine, but in prod you‚Äôll want:

SSH (22) ‚Üí limited to office/VPN IPs

Prometheus/Grafana (9090/3000) ‚Üí usually internal/VPN only

Keep the SG module slim
Don‚Äôt put all SGs into one giant ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù module.
I‚Äôd recommend:

security-group-app (web/app layer)

security-group-db (database layer)

security-group-monitoring

(Optional) security-group-alb

That way you don‚Äôt end up with a ‚Äúgod module‚Äù that‚Äôs hard to maintain.

üëâ Your current method of variabilizing ports + descriptions in root is best practice. I‚Äôd only advise breaking SGs into smaller modules per tier (instead of keeping public, private, monitoring inside one).

Do you want me to refactor your SG module into a 3-tier app structure (alb, web, db, monitoring) while keeping the variabilization style you‚Äôre using?

You said:
yes please and break them into smaller modules per tier as you have suggested. thanks
ChatGPT said:

Perfect üëç ‚Äî let‚Äôs break your security group setup into smaller, tier-based modules. This way, each tier has its own module and is easier to manage across environments (dev/staging/prod).
