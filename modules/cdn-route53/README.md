provision the domain registration + hosted zone + DNS records + CloudFront + Route 53 aliases all in one workflow.

Do you want me to refactor the code into one complete module that:

Registers the domain

Creates the hosted zone

Issues the ACM certificates

Creates CloudFront distributions

Adds DNS aliases

end-to-end Terraform setup that:

Registers a domain via Route 53.

Creates a hosted zone.

Issues two ACM certs (for two subdomains).

Provisions two CloudFront distributions, both pointing to your existing ALB (from EKS).

Creates DNS records for validation + CNAME/Alias records in Route 53.

This way, you can run terraform apply from VS Code and get a working setup without manual steps.




i got this from terraform's registry. if i may ask, the cloudfront.tf code you gave me,what does it create the distribution with? 
is it with an s3 origin or an origin group for failover routing or with an aws Managed Caching Policy or with With V2 logging to S3?

this is my first provisioning cloudfront with terraform so please take your time and explain it for me. which did you give me and what is best practise
for my type of the application which is an eks cluster with argocd managing my apps using apps of application pattern. below is an example from terraform registry


The example below creates a CloudFront distribution with an S3 origin.

The example from the Terraform Registry you pasted

That one provisions a CloudFront distribution with an S3 origin:

The origin is aws_s3_bucket.b.bucket_regional_domain_name.

It also attaches an Origin Access Control (OAC) so CloudFront can securely fetch from the private bucket.

It has:

Multiple ordered cache behaviors (different paths with different TTLs).

V2 logging to S3 (logging_config block).

An AWS Managed default cert (not ACM).

A geo restriction example.

That‚Äôs a static website scenario (React app, docs site, etc.).

2Ô∏è‚É£ The code I gave you

I did not use an S3 origin.
I pointed CloudFront‚Äôs origin to your EKS ALB DNS name (created by the ALB Ingress Controller).

Example excerpt:

origin {
  domain_name = data.aws_lb.eks_alb.dns_name
  origin_id   = "eks-alb-origin"
}


So your EKS-hosted workloads (apps managed by ArgoCD) are served through ALB ‚Üí CloudFront ‚Üí Route 53.

Cache behavior is simple pass-through (minimal caching, default TTLs), because:

Dynamic apps (APIs, dashboards, microservices) often need real-time responses.

You don‚Äôt want CloudFront caching API calls or Grafana charts incorrectly.

This is best practice for containerized workloads behind ALB:

Use ALB as the origin.

Use CloudFront primarily for:

TLS offloading (ACM-managed certs).

Edge distribution (low latency).

Optional WAF integration.

DDoS protection (via AWS Shield).

3Ô∏è‚É£ What about caching policies, logging, failover origins?

Caching:
For APIs (your case), best practice is to forward all headers + query strings and disable aggressive caching.
(If you later add a static frontend in S3, then you apply optimized cache policies.)

Logging:
You can add CloudFront access logs to S3 with:

logging_config {
  bucket = "my-logs-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com"
  prefix = "cloudfront/"
}


But this costs storage; I left it out for simplicity.

Failover origins / origin groups:
That‚Äôs usually for:

Primary = S3 bucket in us-east-1

Secondary = another S3 or ALB
Not needed for your EKS-based app unless you want a DR setup.

Managed cache policies:
AWS provides these (Managed-CachingOptimized, Managed-CachingDisabled).
For API-type traffic, we‚Äôd attach Managed-CachingDisabled.
For static frontend, we‚Äôd use Managed-CachingOptimized.
(I kept it simple, no policy resource yet.)

4Ô∏è‚É£ So, in summary:

The code I gave you = CloudFront with ALB origin, no S3 bucket.

‚úÖ Best practice for EKS apps with ArgoCD.

‚ùå Not for static site hosting.

Caching = minimal (to avoid breaking APIs).

Logging, WAF, or failover = optional enhancements you can add later.

is it standard practise to add the logging config, you left it out in the final one you gave me(see below)

  logging_config {
    bucket = aws_s3_bucket.cf_logs.bucket_domain_name
    prefix = "cloudfront/"
  }

if it is standard practise, i have a logging bucket, i can reference it right?

ChatGPT said:

Great question üëç

Yes ‚Äî it is considered best practice to enable logging for CloudFront distributions, especially in production.

Here‚Äôs why logging is useful:

üìä Security visibility ‚Äì you can see every request (IP, headers, user-agent, etc.).

‚ö° Performance tuning ‚Äì helps debug cache hits/misses.

üõ°Ô∏è Incident response ‚Äì required in case of security investigations.

üí∏ Cost optimization ‚Äì you can analyze request patterns and tweak caching.

‚úÖ How to add it

Since you already have a dedicated S3 logging bucket, you can reference it like this:

logging_config {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.cf_logs.bucket_domain_name
  prefix = "cloudfront/"
  include_cookies = true
}


bucket ‚Üí must be the domain name of the bucket (not ARN).

prefix ‚Üí adds a folder-like structure inside the bucket (optional but helps organize logs).

include_cookies ‚Üí if set to true, CloudFront also logs cookies (useful for apps with sessions).

‚ö†Ô∏è Two important gotchas

The logging bucket must be in the same AWS account as the CloudFront distribution.

(It can be in a different region, but same account is required).

CloudFront will write logs asynchronously (may take a few minutes to appear).


when you say domain name of the bucket, what exactly do you mean?
ChatGPT said:

Good catch üëç ‚Äî that part is very specific in CloudFront.

When CloudFront asks for the bucket in the logging_config block, it does not accept the bucket name or ARN.
Instead, it requires the bucket‚Äôs domain name (aka the "regional domain name").

Example

If your bucket is named my-cf-logs in us-east-1:

Bucket name:

my-cf-logs


ARN:

arn:aws:s3:::my-cf-logs


Domain name (‚úÖ what CloudFront wants):

my-cf-logs.s3.amazonaws.com


or region-specific:

my-cf-logs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

In Terraform

You can safely use the attribute:

logging_config {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.cf_logs.bucket_domain_name
  prefix = "cloudfront/"
}


Here:

bucket_domain_name gives you the correct S3 domain name automatically.

This avoids mistakes (e.g., typing just my-cf-logs).

‚ö†Ô∏è Pro tip: Don‚Äôt confuse with bucket_regional_domain_name ‚Äî that‚Äôs often used for origins (when CloudFront pulls from S3). For logging, bucket_domain_name works fine.


‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes on CloudFront + ACM:

CloudFront only supports ACM certificates issued in us-east-1 (N. Virginia).
That‚Äôs why I used provider = aws.useast1 in the ACM resource.

If you have two distributions (e.g. APIs and dashboards), you typically assign one certificate per distribution.

CloudFront doesn‚Äôt let you attach two certs to the same distribution.

Instead, you‚Äôd create:

Distribution A ‚Üí uses aws_acm_certificate.primary.arn

Distribution B ‚Üí uses aws_acm_certificate.secondary.arn


Got it üöÄ ‚Äî you‚Äôre right, what I just cleaned up was only the module input block (how you call the module). What you‚Äôre asking now is the entire module implementation so that when you run terraform apply, it:

Registers a domain in Route 53

Creates a hosted zone for DNS management

Requests ACM certificates (for both primary + secondary subdomains, validated by DNS)

Creates CloudFront distributions (one for each subdomain, fronting the ALB)

Creates Route 53 records to point the subdomains to CloudFront

Why this resolves dependencies

ACM certs are issued in us-east-1 and must validate via DNS in your hosted zone first ‚Üí we reference aws_acm_certificate_validation.*.certificate_arn in each viewer_certificate, so CloudFront can only build after certificates are valid.

Alias records depend on the CloudFront distributions because they reference domain_name and hosted_zone_id.

Origins in both distributions reference your existing ALB via data "aws_lb", so no guessing or circular deps.

Logging goes to your existing S3 bucket using log_bucket_name ‚Üí we compute ${var.log_bucket_name}.s3.amazonaws.com.

My case: two CloudFront distributions in front of your existing ALB, plus domain registration ‚Üí hosted zone ‚Üí DNS validation ‚Üí certs ‚Üí CloudFront ‚Üí Route 53 aliases. I‚Äôve also included logging to your existing S3 bucket log_bucket.

Note on best practice: Lots of teams don‚Äôt register domains via Terraform (ownership/compliance/billing reasons). But if you control the account and want true IaC, doing it in TF is fine. The only ‚Äúmanual-ish‚Äù concern is ensuring the domain‚Äôs registrar nameservers point to your hosted zone nameservers. When Route 53 is both registrar and DNS (your case), that‚Äôs straightforward.


you gave me these 2. what is the difference? how  many records do we need for the two cloudfront distributions?

ChatGPT said:

Good eye üëÄ ‚Äî you caught the subtle difference between the two setups. Let‚Äôs break it down clearly:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Your first version (route53.tf)
resource "aws_route53_record" "primary_alias" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.main.zone_id
  name    = var.app_domain_primary
  type    = "A"
  alias {
    name                   = aws_cloudfront_distribution.primary.domain_name
    zone_id                = aws_cloudfront_distribution.primary.hosted_zone_id
    evaluate_target_health = false
  }
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "secondary_alias" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.main.zone_id
  name    = var.app_domain_secondary
  type    = "A"
  alias {
    name                   = aws_cloudfront_distribution.secondary.domain_name
    zone_id                = aws_cloudfront_distribution.secondary.hosted_zone_id
    evaluate_target_health = false
  }
}


Only A records created (IPv4).

Works fine if you don‚Äôt care about IPv6 support.

Simpler, fewer resources.

üëâ Each CloudFront distribution (primary & secondary) gets 1 Route53 record each = 2 total records.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Your second version (dns-records.tf)
resource "aws_route53_record" "primary_a" {
  ...
  type = "A"
}
resource "aws_route53_record" "primary_aaaa" {
  count = var.enable_ipv6 ? 1 : 0
  type  = "AAAA"
}
resource "aws_route53_record" "secondary_a" {
  ...
  type = "A"
}
resource "aws_route53_record" "secondary_aaaa" {
  count = var.enable_ipv6 ? 1 : 0
  type  = "AAAA"
}


Creates both A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records for each distribution.

More flexible: if var.enable_ipv6 = true, IPv6 support is automatically enabled.

Recommended for production, because CloudFront supports IPv6 and many ISPs prefer it.

üëâ Each CloudFront distribution gets 2 Route53 records (A + AAAA).
So for 2 CloudFront distributions = 4 total records.

‚úÖ Best practice recommendation

Use the dns-records.tf approach with A + AAAA.

Keep var.enable_ipv6 toggle (default true) so you future-proof things.

üëâ So final answer:

Option 1: 2 records total (if only A/IPv4).

Option 2: 4 records total (A + AAAA for both).


resource "aws_route53_record" "secondary_validation" {
  for_each = {
    for dvo in aws_acm_certificate.secondary.domain_validation_options : dvo.domain_name => {
      name   = dvo.resource_record_name
      record = dvo.resource_record_value
      type   = dvo.resource_record_type
    }
  }
}

This code block is creating Route53 DNS records for ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) certificate validation. Let's break it down:

for_each is creating multiple DNS records based on the validation options provided by ACM
The inner for loop iterates through the domain_validation_options from the secondary ACM certificate
It creates a map where:
The key is dvo.domain_name
The value is an object containing:
name: The DNS record name for validation
record: The value that needs to be added to DNS
type: The DNS record type (typically CNAME)
In simpler terms, when you request an SSL certificate from ACM, AWS needs to verify that you own the domain. This code automatically creates the required DNS records in Route53 to prove domain ownership by transforming the validation information from ACM into DNS records.

The format looks like:


üîë Best Practices for Domains + Hosted Zones
Option 1 ‚Äî Domain + Hosted Zone already exist (most common in teams)

The domain is registered manually (Route 53 registrar, GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.).

A public hosted zone is already created in Route 53 (either manually or via IaC once).

Terraform only manages:

DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, etc.)

CloudFront distributions

ALB integrations

‚úÖ Pros

Avoids Terraform owning the ‚Äúbusiness-critical‚Äù domain asset (registrations can cause compliance/billing headaches if destroyed accidentally).

Safer for shared accounts with multiple teams (you don‚Äôt want one terraform destroy nuking your company domain).

Cleaner separation of concerns: infra IaC manages services + records, not the registrar.


üîë Best Practices to Avoid Nuking Domain / Hosted Zone

Since domain + hosted zone are foundational and long-lived resources, you usually don‚Äôt want them re-applied with every infra change. Here are 3 common approaches:

Option 1 ‚Äì Separate State Files

Put domain-hosted-zone in its own root module (envs/domain/ or envs/shared/) with its own backend/state file.

Apply it once when you set up the account, then leave it alone.

Your dev and prod envs just data-lookup the zone by name.

‚úÖ Safest option.
‚ùå Requires managing multiple Terraform states.

Option 2 ‚Äì Conditional Flag

Inside modules/domain-hosted-zone/main.tf, wrap the zone creation in a conditional:

resource "aws_route53_zone" "this" {
  count = var.create_zone ? 1 : 0
  name  = var.zone_name
}

output "zone_id" {
  value = aws_route53_zone.this[0].zone_id
  # if zone is not created, this will be null
}

variable "create_zone" {
  type    = bool
  default = false
}


Then in dev:

module "domain_zone" {
  source      = "../../modules/domain-hosted-zone"
  zone_name   = "dev.mycoolapp.com"
  create_zone = true
}


In prod (where zone already exists in AWS):

data "aws_route53_zone" "prod" {
  name = "mycoolapp.com"
}

module "cdn" {
  source    = "../../modules/cdn-route53"
  zone_name = data.aws_route53_zone.prod.name
}


‚úÖ Single state file.
‚úÖ Flexible (create new zones in dev, reuse existing in prod).
‚ùå Slightly more logic inside the module.

Option 3 ‚Äì Manual Apply Discipline

Keep everything in one root module.

But: only run terraform apply -target=module.eks (or other targets).

Run terraform apply on module.domain_zone only once.

‚úÖ Simple, no refactor.
‚ùå Risky ‚Äî easy to forget and nuke things by accident.

üèÜ Recommendation

For your setup (since you already have many modules under one root):

Use Option 2 (conditional flag) for flexibility.

Later, if infra grows and more teams use Terraform, refactor to Option 1 (separate state) for safety.

üëâ Do you want me to sketch how your current envs/dev/main.tf would look if we refactor to Option 2 with create_zone flag?


Option 2 ‚Äì Conditional Flag

Inside modules/domain-hosted-zone/main.tf, wrap the zone creation in a conditional:

resource "aws_route53_zone" "this" {
  count = var.create_zone ? 1 : 0
  name  = var.zone_name
}

output "zone_id" {
  value = aws_route53_zone.this[0].zone_id
  # if zone is not created, this will be null
}

variable "create_zone" {
  type    = bool
  default = false
}


Then in dev:

module "domain_zone" {
  source      = "../../modules/domain-hosted-zone"
  zone_name   = "dev.mycoolapp.com"
  create_zone = true
}


In prod (where zone already exists in AWS):

data "aws_route53_zone" "prod" {
  name = "mycoolapp.com"
}

module "cdn" {
  source    = "../../modules/cdn-route53"
  zone_name = data.aws_route53_zone.prod.name
}


‚úÖ Single state file.
‚úÖ Flexible (create new zones in dev, reuse existing in prod).
‚ùå Slightly more logic inside the module.

Option 3 ‚Äì Manual Apply Discipline

Keep everything in one root module.

But: only run terraform apply -target=module.eks (or other targets).

Run terraform apply on module.domain_zone only once.

‚úÖ Simple, no refactor.
‚ùå Risky ‚Äî easy to forget and nuke things by accident.

wire envs/dev to automatically pull the zone_id from the shared hosted zones (via remote state outputs), so you don‚Äôt even have to copy/paste IDs?

You said:
YEP
ChatGPT said:

Perfect üòÉ this is where Terraform Remote State shines.

You can wire envs/dev (or prod) to consume outputs from the shared/hosted-zones root module instead of hardcoding zone IDs.

Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Add Outputs in envs/shared/hosted-zones
# envs/shared/hosted-zones/outputs.tf
output "dev_zone_id" {
  value = module.dev_zone.zone_id
}

output "prod_zone_id" {
  value = module.prod_zone.zone_id

When you run terraform apply in envs/shared/hosted-zones, Terraform will store these outputs in state.

Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Enable Remote State Backend

Make sure both shared/hosted-zones and envs/dev use the same backend (S3 + DynamoDB is common):

# envs/shared/hosted-zones/backend.tf
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "shared/hosted-zones/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

# envs/dev/backend.tf
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Reference Hosted Zones from envs/dev

Use a terraform_remote_state data source:

# envs/dev/data.tf
data "terraform_remote_state" "shared_hosted_zones" {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state"
    key    = "shared/hosted-zones/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

Step 4Ô∏è‚É£: Use the Output in Your Modules
# envs/dev/main.tf
module "cdn" {
  source               = "../../modules/cdn-route53"
  zone_id              = data.terraform_remote_state.shared_hosted_zones.outputs.dev_zone_id
  app_domain_primary   = "app.dev.mycoolapp.com"
  app_domain_secondary = "api.dev.mycoolapp.com"
  alb_name             = "eks-alb-dev"
  enable_cf_logging    = true
  log_bucket_name      = "dev-log-bucket"
}

‚úÖ What This Gives You

Separation of concerns:
Domains & zones live in shared/, while envs just consume them.

No copy/pasting of hosted zone IDs.

Future-proof: You can add staging.mycoolapp.com in shared/hosted-zones and any environment can consume it.
